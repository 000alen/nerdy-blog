On July 2, 2019, Cloudflare, a major provider of web infrastructure and security services, experienced a significant global outage that lasted approximately 27 minutes. This outage disrupted millions of websites and services, generating a wave of 502 errors for users. The root cause? A well-intentioned but poorly optimized regular expression (RegEx) within their Web Application Firewall (WAF). This article will delve into the incident, the underlying concepts of finite automata and regular expressions, and explore the complexity issues that led to catastrophic backtracking.

### Introduction to the Incident

Cloudflare’s WAF is designed to protect websites from various online threats, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, by using pattern-matching rules to identify and block malicious traffic. On July 2, a new RegEx rule was deployed with the intention of enhancing XSS detection. However, this new rule, specifically `.*.*=.*`, led to excessive backtracking that consumed significant CPU resources across Cloudflare’s servers, causing them to reach 100% utilization. As a result, the global network experienced severe disruptions, showcasing the potent risks associated with RegEx and its computational demands.

### The Power and Perils of Regular Expressions

RegEx is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, enabling text matching based on defined rules. It’s a staple tool for developers when processing strings, whether for simple tasks like finding keywords or more complex needs like parsing structured text. However, when constructed poorly, RegEx can be computationally expensive.

The expression `.*.*=.*`, which played a critical role in the Cloudflare outage, was intended to match sequences that potentially indicate XSS payloads. In RegEx syntax:

- `.*` means “match zero or more characters,” and it is greedy, trying to match as much as possible.  
- `=.*` looks for a literal `=` followed by any sequence.

This pattern’s nested structure led to significant backtracking when processing non-matching or large input strings.

### Understanding Backtracking and Computational Complexity

<Sim />

Backtracking in RegEx engines occurs when a match attempt fails, prompting the engine to reconsider previous choices and explore alternative matches. This is especially problematic when using patterns like `.*` because the engine tries to match all possibilities before concluding that no match is found. The backtracking process has exponential time complexity, often denoted as `O(2^n)`, where n is the length of the input string.

To illustrate, consider the pattern `.*.*=.*` matching a string like `x=xx`. The RegEx engine:

1. Matches the first `.*` against the entire string `x=xx`.  
2. Attempts the second `.*`, consuming remaining characters.  
3. Fails to match `=`, so it backtracks and retries with different groupings.  
4. This process repeats, exploring multiple paths before a successful match or failure.

With each additional character, the number of potential paths grows, resulting in exponential growth in processing time—a concept similar to traversing the branches of a binary tree.


### Finite Automata and Efficient Pattern Matching

Finite Automata (FA) provide an elegant solution to the limitations of traditional backtracking-based RegEx engines. The two main types are:

- **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**: Processes each input symbol exactly once, ensuring linear time complexity `O(n)`. DFAs have no backtracking since they always know which state to move to based on the current input.  
- **Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**: Can transition into multiple states simultaneously, representing all potential matches at once. This parallel processing allows NFAs to mimic backtracking without the computational cost.

The power of finite automata lies in their predictable time complexity, making them suitable for high-performance applications. Ken Thompson’s 1968 algorithm for converting RegEx into an NFA paved the way for linear-time pattern matching, a crucial consideration for modern applications handling large data volumes.

### How Catastrophic Backtracking Unfolded at Cloudflare

<Simulation>

<Params />

The expression `.*.*=.*` was part of a broader rule designed to catch complex XSS payloads. While it was syntactically valid, the combination of wildcards and nesting created a situation where the RegEx engine had to attempt a vast number of permutations to find matches.

<Demand />

**Before the Change**: Cloudflare’s WAF was functioning with existing rules that, although less aggressive, were optimized for performance. The implementation of RegEx patterns at this stage was well-vetted and tested for efficiency.

<Latency />

**The Change**: The new rule aimed for greater sensitivity to threats but inadvertently introduced catastrophic backtracking. The deployment process, governed by Cloudflare’s rapid Quicksilver system, pushed this change globally within seconds, overwhelming servers with CPU-intensive operations.

<Rejection />

**The Incident**: Servers across the network hit maximum CPU usage, leading to widespread failures. The outage was initially mistaken for an attack but was soon identified as a WAF rule issue.

### Visualizing Before and After

To understand the impact of the RegEx change, consider these side-by-side scenarios:

- **Before**: Existing RegEx rules scanned inputs efficiently without excessive backtracking, maintaining CPU levels within acceptable thresholds.  
- **After**: The introduction of `.*.*=.*` caused exponential backtracking, leading to spikes in CPU consumption and service outages.

### Resolution and Lessons Learned

Cloudflare quickly took action to mitigate the issue:

1. **Rollback**: The problematic rule was disabled within 27 minutes, restoring service.  
2. **Reevaluation**: The WAF rules were reviewed to identify potential backtracking risks.  
3. **Technology Shift**: Plans were made to transition from PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions) to regex engines like RE2 or Rust’s regex library, which provide linear-time guarantees.

### Broader Implications and Future Safeguards

Cloudflare’s outage underscored the importance of understanding algorithmic complexity in real-world systems. The choice of tools and their underlying algorithms directly impacts system reliability, especially at scale. Finite automata and linear-time regex engines offer robust alternatives that prevent catastrophic scenarios caused by backtracking.

In addition, thorough performance profiling and staged rollouts are essential safeguards. Cloudflare’s post-incident actions included performance testing enhancements and updated procedures for global deployments, ensuring that similar issues could be preemptively detected.

### Conclusion

The 2019 Cloudflare outage served as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with computational complexity in pattern matching. While regular expressions remain an invaluable tool, they must be carefully managed to avoid pitfalls like catastrophic backtracking. Leveraging finite automata and linear-time regex engines, combined with rigorous testing and staged rollouts, can mitigate these risks. Cloudflare’s quick response and subsequent improvements exemplify a commitment to resilience, ensuring that lessons from this incident strengthen future operations.
